# Elevation data downloader
Project goal: Employ HTTP GET/POST to download elevation data and create heightmap textures

PROS: raw elevation data is stored for you in csv file for futher use

CONS: heightmaps are saved as 3*8 bit png


TODO: add option for 1*16 bit RAW files

TODO2: Unity encoder doesn't allow 1*16 bit png, fix that
